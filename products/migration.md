# ⏭ Migration

In order to keep earning staking rewards, you will need to migrate your farms and pools staking to the new WagFarms. But chill, its super easy.

{% hint style="info" %}
**But wait!** **Do I need to migrate?**

You need to migrate if you are:

* Farming on WagyuSwap **Farms**.
* Staking in WagyuSwap **WAG Sizzle Pools**.
{% endhint %}

## How to migrate?

### 1. Navigate to the migration helper

Go to [https://WagyuSwap.finance/migration](https://exchange.wagyuswap.app/migration), and connect your wallet.

### 2. Unstake from the old farms

There are two steps in the migration helper. In the first step, you should see a list of three WAG sizzle pools and farms you are currently staking.



Click "**Unstake All**" on each of the farms and pools to unstake all your assets.

After unstaking, click "Go to Stake" to proceed to the next step.

### 3. Stake your LP tokens and WAG into the new farms and pools.

Here you should see the brand new WAG sizzle pool and the new farms. Before staking, you will need to enable them.

Click "**Enable**" to enable staking on each of the farms and the WAG sizzle pool. If you are using a mobile device, please click the “**v**” (downward arrow) to expand the card while looking for the "**Enable**" button.

After enabling, you will be able to start staking in the pool and farms.

### 4. Done!

You are now staking in the new WAGFarms and continue earning WAG rewards! Click "**Finish**" to go back and explore some other great products WagyuSwap offers.
