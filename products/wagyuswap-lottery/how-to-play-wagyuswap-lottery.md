# How to Play WagyuSwap Lottery

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/HOW TO\_ LOTTERY.jpg>)

The WagyuSwap Lottery is the latest way to cook up some juicy WAG. It's so simple you don't even have to go to the kitchen. Using VRF technology, it's entirely fair and a whole bunch of fun. You can find all the info you need below.

## **Deciding if you'd like to Enter a Round**

Just how all Chefs are special and unique, so are the rounds in the WagyuSwap Lottery!

If the Prize Pool Level(s) isn't won, it will roll over into the following round, thus increasing the prize pool for the next round. Therefore, the longer we go without a winner, the BIGGER the Prize Pool gets.

‌And the longer the round is open, the more people can purchase a ticket. And with each ticket that is sold, it increases the prize pool even further. You can look here to check the current round's prize pool and remaining time. ‌

1. Visit the WagyuSwap Lottery page, and at the top of the page, you'll see the current round and its prize pool shown in US dollar (estimated value).
2. ‌And if you go further down the page, you will be able to see the remaining time before the current round's Winning Tickets are drawn.

Please note that something can always change in the remaining time, more tickets could be sold and thus increasing the prize pool but at the same time reducing your individual odds of winning. (May the odds ever been in your favor)

## **Buying Lottery Tickets**

Buying tickets is so easy. You just need a little WAG though as each ticket costs approximately $5 USD (the exact WAG price is set at the start of the round).

When getting your ticket, you can choose to have your numbers randomly selected or if you're feeling lucky, you can pick them yourself.

We have a detailed breakdown of either selection method below.
